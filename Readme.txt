GPD Sliding Cannon
by Gregory Desrosiers

Project Date: September 16 - 18, 2016

This was my project at Hack the North 2016 in Waterloo, Canada. It was an experimentation project built for the Android phones as I had a thought, and drew down some concepts, about building a full game based on it for the Nintendo Wii U.
